# Probabilistic language guided attention for Classification models 


  
  
## About the Project
This is a project by Svante Andersson, Olle Flygar, Leo Kemetli and Edvard Schmidt. It was supervised by Prashant Singh and Li Ju at Uppsala University. The project investigates the integration of
probabilistic embeddings in a language guided attention learning task.

## Introduction
This is the PyTorch implementation the project. The point of entry in this repository is the ProbVLM folder for training the adapter to later be used for attention map generation. Run the
`train_ProbVLM_...` appropariate for the model and dataset. Then attention maps can be generated throught the `Attention_maps_for...` file.

In the BayesVLM framework one can directly run the attention map generating file 'attention_waterXX_Bayes.py' to generate attention maps via the RISE based approach using a 500-mask based saliency map.

Finnally, to run the downstream task, run `main.py` in the GALS folder with adequate parsers. See references for a thorough walkthrough.



## Paper

<!-- Prerequisites -->
## Prerequisites
To run the ProbVLM files, run 
```bash 
  conda install -r requirements.txt
```
Use pip to install the following packages also necesary: XX, XX, XX, XX.
The BayesVLM code can be run on the same requirements.
Use the requirements.txt found in GASL in a similar manor along with the config files (.yaml) found in '/configs' foun in the GALS folder.
